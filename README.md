# airpods-pro-1

Steps i have taken:

1. Searched on google with "apple airpods pro javascript scroll effect", found some results with videos that explains to how to achieve the same effect while scrolling.
2. Found useful articles & videos that help how to achieve that animation while scrolling.
3. Used one of the options that illustrate how to achieve the same effect used in the AirPods Pro page by scrolling through the video video frames forward/backward.
4. Created the project folder with files ( Html page, Css file, javascript file & video file )
5. Created an html page with 2 sections ( 1st one which will have the scrolling animation effect )
6. Added libraries used in the project: "ScrollMagic" used in the interaction of the scrolling
7. Added libraries used in the project: "GSAP" used to animate objects
8. Added libraries used in the project: "ScrollMagic-Debug Indicator" to add visual indicator where the scroll trigger and where it ends.
9. Added libraries used in the project "Tweenmax" used it in the animation of the text.
10. Everything else related to the code you can check the comments written above/next each part of code.
